**Summary**

It was my first time building an app using the MERN stack. I have learnt React hook, MongoDB and Node.js through this project. It was quite a challenge for me to learn something new and build an app at the same time but I really enjoyed it. After finishing up the project, I have a better knowledge of the MERN stack and also gained confidence at the same time.
